# dyad-app-html-css-js-php

A **Dyad starter project template** that overrides Dyad’s default React-based setup.  
By importing this repository into Dyad, you will generate a **basic project using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, following strict rules to keep the stack lightweight, accessible, and framework-free.

## 🚀 Purpose

Dyad by default creates new projects with **React** and other modern libraries.  
This template exists to **enforce a pure stack** of HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP — ensuring developers can start from a clean baseline without frontend or backend frameworks beyond the approved ones.

- **Frontend Styling:** CSS3
- **Frontend Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend:** PHP 8.x (or 7.4+)
